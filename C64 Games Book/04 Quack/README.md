04 Quack (Page 20)

This is the old fair ground game but instead of using bullets you are equipped with a bow and arrow. An arrow will of course travel slower than a bullet and thus requires better anticipation. The ducks do not move at a uniform speed which makes the game a lot harder. You have a limited number of arrows and also a time limit.

Your controls are:
'Z' left
'C' right
'M' to fire an arrow

Modifications made to machine code version:

1. The text to the right has been aligned and an 'arrows' label added
2. Duck movement is now 1 pixel at a time so they are not too fast in machine code

The description above from the book suggests the ducks move at a variable speed, but there is nothing in the original basic to make it happen. It would be relatively easy to build in to the program however.

I have not managed to code the sound effects yet as my SID/machine code programming knowledge is currently quite limited.

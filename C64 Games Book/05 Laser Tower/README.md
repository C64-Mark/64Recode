## 05 Laser Tower  

Escape from the Laser Tower, battling against gravity and evading the tractor beam. The tractor beam fires from the tower on the left of the screen. It alters its height as you move away from it, trying to land in the pit at the right.  

Your controls are: cursor up for up, cursor right for right.

# 64Recode
Inspired by @oldskoolcoder and in an attempt to learn and improve upon my C64 programming skills, I have decided to recode some old BASIC programs in machine language.

Starting with the C64 Games Book, and hopefully moving on to other texts and sources.

Feel free to contribute with additions, corrections etc. etc.
